        <p>Male domestic cats are more prone than females to fight. The most prevalent reason for cat fighting among feral cats is rivalry between two males for a female. In such instances, the heavier guy usually wins the battle. Another typical cause of domestic cat fights is the difficulties of establishing territories in a tiny environment. Female cats battle for territory or to protect their babies. In many cases, neutering will reduce or eliminate this tendency, suggesting that the habit is connected to sex hormones.</p>

    <a id="play"><h2>Playing</h2></a>
<p>When cats are hungry, they also play with toys more.  Because play and hunting are so similar, cats like to play with things that imitate prey, such as little furry toys that move quickly but lose interest. They get used to a toy they have previously used.  String is commonly used as a toy, but if swallowed, it can become trapped at the base of the cat's tongue and subsequently migrate into the bowels, causing significant sickness, if not death.  Due of the dangers of cats chewing thread, it is occasionally substituted by a laser pointer's dot, which cats may chase.</p>

    <p>Cats are popular pets all throughout the world, and their global population surpassed 500 million in 2007.Cats have been employed to control rodents for millennia, most notably in grain stockpiles and aboard ships, and both usage continue to the current day.
<br>
        Cats are used in the worldwide fur trade and the leather industries to create coats, hats, blankets, and stuffed toys;and shoes, gloves, and musical instruments respectively (about 24 cats are needed to make a cat-fur coat).
        <br>
        This practice has been prohibited in the United States since 2000, and in the European Union (together with the United Kingdom) since 2007.</p>

    <p>Cat pelts have been used for superstitious purposes as part of witchcraft practice, and are still manufactured into blankets in Switzerland as traditional medicine believed to heal rheumatism.</p> <div class="photos"><img src="images/witch.jpg">

    <p>A few attempts have been made over the years to create a cat census, both through associations or national and international organizations (such as the Canadian Federation of Humane Societies) and through the Internet, however such a job does not appear to be easy to accomplish. The global population of domestic cats is estimated to be somewhere between 200 million and 600 million people. Walter Chandoha built a career out of shooting cats when his photographs of Loco, a particularly endearing stray, were published all over the world in 1949. During his career, he is said to have photographed 90,000 cats and kept a collection of 225,000 photographs from which he drew for publications.</p>
