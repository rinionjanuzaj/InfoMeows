            >
            <p>
              The domestic cat (Felis catus) is a tiny carnivorous animal.It is
              the only domesticated species in the Felidae family and is
              sometimes referred to as the domestic cat to distinguish it from
              the family's wild members.A cat can be categorized as a house cat,
              a farm cat, or a feral cat, the latter of which roams freely and
              avoids human interaction.Humans cherish domestic cats for their
              companionship and their capacity to destroy rats.

              <a id="dom"> <h2>Domestication</h2></a>
              <p>
                The earliest documented evidence for the domestication of an
                African wildcat (F. lybica) was discovered near a human
                Neolithic cemetery at Shillourokambos, southern Cyprus, about
                7500-7200 BC. Cats' anatomy and behavior have changed relatively
                slightly after domestication, and they are still capable of
                living in the wild. Several natural traits and habits of
                wildcats may have pre-adapted them for domestication as pets.
                Their tiny size, sociable nature, obvious body language, love
                for play, and relatively high intellect are among these
                characteristics.

              <h3>Size</h3>
              <p>
                The European wildcat has a larger cranium and shorter bones than
                the domestic cat.It has a head-to-body length of around 46 cm
                (18 in) and a height of about 23-25 cm (9-10 in), with tails
                that are about 30 cm (12 in) long. Males are physically bigger
                than females.

              </div>
              <h3>Skeleton</h3>
              <p>
                Cats have seven cervical vertebrae (as do most mammals), 13
                thoracic vertebrae (as do humans), seven lumbar vertebrae (as do
                humans), three sacral vertebrae (as do most mammals, while
                humans have five), and a variable number of caudal vertebrae in
                the tail (humans have only three to five vestigial caudal
                vertebrae, fused into an internal coccyx)
              </p>
              <h3>Skull</h3>
              <p>
                Cat skulls are unique among animals in that they have
                exceptionally wide eye sockets and a powerful specialized jaw.
                Cats' jaws are equipped with teeth designed for killing animals
                and shredding flesh. When a cat overpowers its victim, it uses
                its two large canine teeth to administer a devastating neck
                bite, placing them between two of the prey's vertebrae and
                severing its spinal cord, causing irreversible paralysis and
                death.

              <h3>Claws</h3>
              <p>
                Cats have claws that can extend and retract.The claws are
                enclosed with skin and fur around the toe pads of the paw in
                their usual, relaxed state. This maintains the claws sharp by
                reducing wear from ground contact and enables for quiet
                surveillance of prey. The forefeet's claws are usually sharper
                than the hindfeet's. Cats may lengthen their claws on one or
                more paws voluntarily. Claws may be extended for hunting or
                self-defense, climbing, kneading, or increased traction on soft
                terrain.
              </p>

              <h3>Balance</h3>
              <p>
                During a fall from a great height, a cat uses its excellent
                sense of balance and flexibility to twist its body and right
                itself to land on its feet. The cat righting reflex is the name
                given to this reaction. If a cat has enough time to do so, as is
                the case in falls of 90 cm (2 ft 11 in) or more, it will always
                right itself in the same way The "fallen cat problem" has been
                studied to see how cats can correct themselves after falling.
